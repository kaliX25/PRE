            Resimac offers a range of vessel and tank lining coatings which can
            be applied to metallic and concrete surfaces giving long term
            chemical protection. Their unique composite wrap system can seal
            large diameter pipe and restore lost surface wall thickness. Once
            cured, Resimac systems can withstand pressures up to 300psi and
            in-service immersion temperatures up to 120C.

            We incorporate the use of Safety Tools Allmetâ€™s unique cold work
            surface preparation grinding and cutting tools. These tools are
            ATEX-certified for explosive environments and conform to the SSPC
            SP11 surface treatment standard after grinding. This allows us to
            prepare surfaces for vessel and tank reinforcement treatments safely
            and efficiently.

            For magnesium alloys, we use Magnaseal Forge Tech/Bonding solutions,
            which have shown promising results in corrosion protection56. Their
            key product, MAGNASEAL, is a unique, patented, magnetic urethane
            sheet that is redefining the way first responders, hazmat
            technicians, and other industry professionals handle leaks of
            hazardous materials. It can hold back at least 30 pounds of
            pressure, making it an excellent choice for vessel and tank
            reinforcement.
